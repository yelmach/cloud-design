## Cloud-Design

### Overview

This project focuses on designing, deploying, and operating a cloud-based
microservices application on Amazon Web Services (AWS). It guides learners
through building a scalable, secure, and observable infrastructure using
modern DevOps and cloud-native practices.

### Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Design a cloud-based microservices architecture on AWS.
- Deploy and manage containerized applications using AWS-managed services.
- Implement monitoring, logging, and auto-scaling strategies.
- Secure applications and databases using AWS networking and identity services.
- Analyze and optimize cloud infrastructure for performance and cost.

### Instructions

In this project, you will design and deploy a cloud-based microservices
architecture on AWS using Terraform, Docker, and AWS orchestration tools like
ECS or EKS. You will configure networking, storage, load balancing, and
auto-scaling to ensure scalability, availability, and security. Finally, you
will implement monitoring and logging, and document your solution in a README.md
file.

### Role-play

To enhance the learning experience and assess your knowledge, a role-play
question session will be included as part of the Cloud-Design Project. This
section will involve answering a series of questions in a simulated real-world
scenario where you assume the role of a cloud engineer explaining your solution
to a team or stakeholder.

The goal of the role-play question session is to:

- Assess your understanding of the concepts and technologies used in the
  project.
- Test your ability to communicate effectively and explain your decisions.
- Challenge you to think critically about your solution and consider
  alternative approaches.

Prepare for a role-play question session where you will assume the role of a
cloud engineer presenting your solution to your team or a stakeholder. You
should be ready to answer questions and provide explanations about your
decisions, architecture, and implementation.

### Architecture

By using the solutions from your previous projects `crud-master`,
`play-with-containers`, and `orchestrator` you have to design and deploy the
infrastructure on AWS respecting the project requirements, consisting of the
following components:

- The `inventory-db` container is a PostgreSQL database server that contains
  the inventory database. It must be accessible via port `5432`.
- The `billing-db` container is a PostgreSQL database server that contains
  the billing database. It must be accessible via port `5432`.
- The `inventory-app` container is a server that contains the
  inventory-app code running and connected to the inventory database and
  accessible via port `8080`.
- The `billing-app` container is a server that contains the billing-app
  code running and connected to the billing database and consuming messages
  from the RabbitMQ queue, and it can be accessed via port `8080`.
- The `rabbit-queue` container is a RabbitMQ server that contains the queue.
- The `api-gateway-app` container is a server that contains the
  API gateway code running and forwarding the requests to the other
  services, and it is accessible via port `3000`.

Design the architecture for your cloud-based microservices application. You
are free to choose the services and architectural patterns that best suit your
needs, as long as they meet the project requirements and remain within a
reasonable cost range. Consider the following when designing your architecture:

1. `Scalability`: Ensure that your architecture can handle varying workloads
   and can scale up or down as needed. AWS offers services like Auto Scaling
   that can be used to achieve this.

2. `Availability`: Design your architecture to be fault-tolerant and maintain
   high availability, even in the event of component failures.

3. `Security`: Incorporate security best practices into your architecture, such
   as encrypting data at rest and in transit, using private networks, and
   securing API endpoints. Also, ensure that the databases and private
   resources are accessible only from the AWS VPC and use AWS managed
   authentication for publicly accessible applications.

4. `Cost-effectiveness`: Be mindful of the costs associated with the services
   and resources you select. Aim to design a cost-effective architecture
   without compromising performance, security, or scalability.

5. `Simplicity`: Keep your architecture as simple as possible, while still
   meeting the project requirements. Avoid overcomplicating the design with
   unnecessary components or services.

### Cost management

1. `Understand the pricing model`: Familiarize yourself with the pricing model
   of the cloud provider and services you are using. Be aware of any free
   tiers, usage limits, and pay-as-you-go pricing structures.

2. `Monitor your usage`: Regularly check your cloud provider's billing
   dashboard to keep track of your usage and spending. Set up billing alerts to
   notify you when your spending exceeds a certain threshold.

3. `Clean up resources`: Remember to delete or stop any resources that you no
   longer need, such as virtual machines, storage services, and load balancers.
   This will help you avoid ongoing charges for idle resources.

4. `Optimize resource allocation`: Use the appropriate resource sizes for your
   needs and experiment with different configurations to find the most
   cost-effective solution. Consider using spot instances, reserved instances,
   or committed use contracts to save on costs, if applicable.

5. `Leverage cost management tools`: Many cloud providers offer cost management
   tools and services to help you optimize your spending. Use these tools to
   analyze your usage patterns and identify opportunities for cost savings.

> By being aware of your cloud usage and proactively managing your resources,
> you can avoid unexpected costs and make the most of your cloud environment.
> Remember that the responsibility for cost management lies with you, and it is
> crucial to stay vigilant and proactive throughout the project.

### Infrastructure as Code

Provision the necessary AWS resources using Terraform as an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool.” This includes setting up EC2 instances,
containers, networking components, and storage services (such as AWS S3 or similar services).

### Containerize the microservices

Use Docker to build container images for each microservice. Make sure to
optimize the Dockerfile for each service to reduce the image size and build
time.

### Deployment

Deploy the containerized microservices on AWS using an orchestration tool like
AWS ECS or EKS. Ensure that the services are load-balanced (consider using AWS
Elastic Load Balancer) and can communicate with each other securely.

> Use [this solution](https://github.com/01-edu/orchestrator) to kick-start
> your Kubernetes deployment.

### Monitoring and logging

Set up monitoring and logging tools to track the performance and health of your
application. Use tools like CloudWatch, Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack to
visualize metrics and logs.

### Optimization

Implement auto-scaling policies to handle varying workloads and ensure high
availability. Test the application under different load scenarios and adjust
the resources accordingly.

### Security

Implement security best practices such as using AWS Certificate Manager for
HTTPS, securing API endpoints with Amazon API Gateway, regularly scanning for
vulnerabilities with AWS Inspector, and implementing managed authentication for
publicly accessible applications with AWS Cognito or similar service. Ensure
that the databases and private resources are secure and accessible only from
the AWS VPC.

### Documentation

Create a `README.md` file that provides comprehensive documentation for your
architecture, which must include well-structured diagrams, thorough
descriptions of components, and an explanation of your design decisions,
presented in a clear and concise manner. Make sure it contains all the
necessary information about the solution (prerequisites, setup, configuration,
usage, ...). This file must be submitted as part of the solution for the
project.

### Bonus

If you complete the mandatory part successfully and you still have free time,
you can implement anything that you feel deserves to be a bonus, for example:

- Use your own `crud-master`, `play-with-containers`, and `orchestrator`
  solution instead of the provided ones.

- Use `Function as a Service (FaaS)` in your solution.

- Use `Content Delivery Network (CDN)` to optimize your solution.

- Implement alerting systems to ensure your application runs smoothly.

Challenge yourself!
